# Linux Namespace
This project is used to make two network namespace on linux os and connect them using virtual ethernet interface.
A network namespace is a powerful feature of Linux. In Linux, a network namespace is a way to create separate and isolated networks within a single computer. Itâ€™s like having multiple virtual networks on the same machine. It allows different processes or groups of processes to have their own independent network stacks, network interfaces, IP addresses, routing tables, and other network-related resources.
